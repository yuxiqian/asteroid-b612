# Data Analysis
## Data Origin
The major data source is the `MCM_NFLIS_Data.xlsx ` file. It contains all incidents involved with narcotic analgesics and heroin occurring since 2010 to 2017. The first phase of problem requires focusing on this part of data, temporarily leaving the social-economical dataset aside.
## Main Factors
There’s some data factor in this sheet particularly attracting, which helps a lot in figuring out the drug crisis.
* Substance
	The main substances of all incidents were provided, hence we may separately analyze how different kinds of drugs spreads among the northeast U.S.
* Incident Count
	Many drugs involved in all these incidents, but they’re not equally significant. The reports’ count recording the troubles they made can be a convincing factor to determine how influential one drug is.
* County Location
	The specific county name in OH, KY, WV, VA and PA are provided in detail. Thanks to[Simple Maps Corp.][1]’s great work and generous contribution, we could get accurate longitude and latitude to locate a single county. That would be a great help in visualizing our analysis.
