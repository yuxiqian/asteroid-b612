# Conclusion
In this paper, we generated a database containing geography location and history case reports first. Then we use opioid and heroin case history as fitting foundation, taking internal autoregressive and external affecting factor as fitting target parameters to solve Problem 1. After getting the weight of each edge indicating the spreading index, we construct the abstracted graph to find the propagation source of one specific drug. In the following Problem 2, we use all drug typesâ€™ cases data to re-fit the parameters above in the legacy way. Then, we utilize the eco-social data in the AHP procedure to determine the correlation index, and optimize the internal autoregressive model. Finally, we validates our model and figure out the suggestions and solutions to the practical problems.
