### Situation

Our research based on eastnorthern 5 states reveals that American opioid and heroin related crime frequency is strongly regional and spatial.
The total incident amount of each county floats around a reference value, at the same time, significantly affected by nearby counties and border geographical environment. Specific kinds of drug's propagation indicates the existence of drug selling chain and regional crime gang. Drug control faces a complex situation and great pressure.

### Influencing Factor
According to economic research reports from NFLIS, the crime frequency is 52.16% related to culture factors, including nationality ratio, first language proportion, and ancestral combination of its population. It is also 31.82% related to education factors, as the education level and dropout rate of its population. It is merely 16.02% related to family factors, e.g., family people numbers, relatives' health status, and martial status.

### Prediction
In the next decade, American opioid and heroin crime cases would keep increasing spirally. It is predicted that the growth-recession cycle is distributed between 3.5 years and 12.5 years, along with an approximately 10% increase by each cycle. Regional criminal gangs would develop closer communication, leading to the synchronized periodical floating of crime cases in a specific region. Consequently the managing of drugs would be much harder.

### Advice
Ordered by importance, as following:

* Raise the attention of drug crime, and implement strict drug managing laws. Control the planting and import of drug crops with the help of U.S. Department of Agriculture and Commerce.

* Combat the drug criminals according to its growth-recession cycle, deploy police force in advance, and maintain a low level of stability in the number of criminals.

* Pay more attention to crimes around the inter-state borders, cut drug trafficking channel, and promote interstate cooperation in drug controlling system.

* Legislate for aggravated punishment.


## Summary

### Drug Crime Control Measures for The Opioid Crisis

随着美国正在经历一场国家性的阿片类药物危机，而这正在给社会的医疗和安全带来巨大的消极影响，我们尝试建立毒品传播时空模型用以刻画美国阿片类药物的使用情况和传播特点，并向政府给出毒品管控建议。

首先，我们建立起五个州每个郡相关关系的图，并考虑一个郡自身变化的时间因素和临近郡对它影响的空间因素建立起方程，成功刻画了阿片类药物案例数逐年变化的曲线。通过对方程的分析，我们可以得到毒品变化的规律。借助图中最小生成树的性质，我们可以找到毒品传播的源头。

其次，我们借助模型一和人口经济调查表更加明确自身变化的时间因素。我们将数据信息视为指标选择性归为三个准则，并用层次分析法给出了各个准则与毒品犯罪的相关性和重要程度。这样把分析结果归入模型一中的方程，我们发现模型更加接近实际曲线。

最后，我们通过修改后的模型成功分析了全国毒品犯罪的特点，并用图中中心度的知识识别了区域性的毒品中心，参考其他国家地区的措施，我们给出了针对美国具体的管控措施和实施方法。

总之，经过修改和测试，我们的模型很好地适应了对美国阿片类药物危机的描述，可以成功给出解决阿片类药物危机切实可行的方案。除此之外，我们认为此模型还可以应用于对其他学科局部区域相互影响关系和总体统筹分析的场景，如不同地区销售定价，新闻舆论传播等。
