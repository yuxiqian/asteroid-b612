# Weakness
* When calculating distance between counties, the curvature of the earth isn’t considered. These 5 states’ latitude varies between 36° N and 42° N.
	That causes notable bias when the latitude difference can’t be ignored. 
* Not all social and economic factor data is accessible, so the model can’t be complete as lacking traffic, politics, and laws information.
* Only 5 states’ data of the U.S. were provided, so these counties lying in the borderline between the 5 states and the rest would not be well described.
