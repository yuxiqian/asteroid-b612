### Situation

Our research based on east-northern 5 states reveals that American opioid and heroin related crime frequency is strongly regional and spatial.
The total incident amount of each county floats around a reference value, at the same time, significantly affected by nearby counties and border geographical environment. Specific kinds of drug's propagation indicates the existence of drug selling chain and regional crime gang. Drug control faces a complex situation and great pressure.

### Influencing Factor
According to economic research reports from NFLIS, the crime frequency is 52.16% related to culture factors, including nationality ratio, first language proportion, and ancestral combination of its population. It is also 31.82% related to education factors, as the education level and dropout rate of its population. It is merely 16.02% related to family factors, e.g., family people numbers, relatives' health status, and martial status.

### Prediction
In the next decade, American opioid and heroin crime cases would keep increasing spirally. It is predicted that the growth-recession cycle is distributed between 3.5 years and 12.5 years, along with an approximately 10% increase by each cycle. Regional criminal gangs would develop closer communication, leading to the synchronized periodical floating of crime cases in a specific region. Consequently the managing of drugs would be much harder.

### Advice
Ordered by importance, as following:

* Raise the attention of drug crime, and implement strict drug managing laws. Control the planting and import of drug crops with the help of U.S. Department of Agriculture and Commerce.

* Combat the drug criminals according to its growth-recession cycle, deploy police force in advance, and maintain a low level of stability in the number of criminals.

* Pay more attention to crimes around the inter-state borders, cut drug trafficking channel, and promote interstate cooperation in drug controlling system.

* Legislate for aggravated punishment.


## Summary

### Drug Crime Control Measures for The Opioid Crisis

American is suffering from a national opioid crisis, bringing huge impact on the health and safety of society. We attempted to build a Time-Space model to describe the opioid usage and transportation traits in America, and giving advice to the government on drug control.

First, we build a relationship graph containing every county in these 5 states, consider the autoregressive internal factor and nearby counties' external affecting factor of each county, and build the equation that characterizes the variation of the opioid incident cases. We get the rule describing drug crime cases count by analyzing the equations, and get the source of drug propagation by the minimum spanning tree.

Then, we clarify the internal floating factor by considering the population and economic investigation report. We classify various factors into three major types, and determine their relevance and significance by AHP. Subsuming these economical and social factors into the equations, we get a much better fitting model and less deviations.

Finally, we successfully describe national drug criminalsâ€™ traits with the modified model, and identify regional drug centers by the degree of centrality in the graph. We provide advice to the government by referring to the drug measures in other countries and regions.

Overall, our model adapts well in the problem of describing the the U.S. opioid crisis, and is able to give out a practical solution. Besides, we believe that this model can also be applied to those scenarios of interactions and overall analysis of local areas in other disciplines, such as sales pricing in different regions, news dissemination and public opinion.
